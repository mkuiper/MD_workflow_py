Summary of the changes to the CHARMM toppar files since ca. 1995.  The
text gives a good overview of the expansion and improvements in the
CHARMM force field as a function of the versions of charmm.

Recent advances in the development of empirical force field parameters
have led to frequent updates of the all-hydrogen (all22) parameter
sets supplied with charmm.  Currently, the all-hydrogen parameters are
updated with the release of every version of charmm.  In order to
allow the user to remain current with the evolution of the parameters
and to obtain parameters from previously released versions of charmm
the following procedure in being instituted as of January 1994,
coinciding with the release of charmm versions c23f3 and c24a1.  This
system will also allow users in publicatons to specify the version of
charmm from which the parameters were obtained.  Other users will then
be able to readily obtain the particular version of the parameters and
reproduce the published work if so desired.

1) The toppar directory will contain only the parameters released with
the current version of charmm.  Note that the all22 topology and
parameter filenames will not change with new versions of charmm as of
the c22g5_c23f2 release.  Information on dates and parameter
development associated version numbers will be placed in the
individual file headers.  Parameter development version numbers will
be maintained separately from the charmm version number to accomodate
the lack of change in a particular file between different versions of
charmm. Topology and parameter files that are coupled will have the
same version numbers.  In this system the charmm parameters will be
updated only when a new version of charmm is released.  The interested
user can get information on intermediate developments in the
parameters by contacting the parameter discussion forum at
www.charmm.org.

2) A history of changes to the parameters, see below, will be included
with the toppar directory in the file toppar_all.history.  This will
contain general information on changes between consecutive versions of
the parameters.  The user may "diff" files of interest to obtain the
exact changes made.  

3) A toppar_history directory tree will be incorporated into the
support directory.  Subdirectories will be named based on the
different versions of charmm.  Some subdirectory names will contain
more than one charmm version descriptor.  This will occur only when
those versions have been released simultaneously, such that the
parameters are identical.  Once a toppar_history subdirectory has
been created it will never be altered.

4) current subdirectories in toppar_history

 toppar/toppar_history/c22g2_g3_g4_c23a1_a2_f1
   => from versions c22g2, c22g3, c22g4, c23a1, c23a2 and c23f1
 toppar/toppar_history/c22g5_c23a2_f2
   => from versions c22g5 and c23f2
 toppar/toppar_history/c23f3_f4_f5_c24a1_a2_a3
   => from versions c23f3, c23f4, c23f5, c24a1, c24a2 and c24a3
 toppar/toppar_history/c24b1
   => from version c24b1
 toppar/toppar_history/c24b2_g1_g2_c25a0_a1_a2_a3
   => from versions c24b2, c24g1, c24g2, c25a0, c25a1, c25a2 and c25a3
 toppar/toppar_history/c25b1_b2_c26a1_a2
   => from versions c25b1, c25b2, c26a1 and c26a2
 toppar/toppar_history/c26b1_b2_c27a1_a2
   => from versions c26b1, c26b2, c27a1, and c27a2
 toppar/toppar_history/c28a1_to_c31a2
   => versions c28a1 through c31a2
 toppar/toppar_history/c31b1
   => version c31b1 
 
5) Extended atom parameter sets for proteins and nucleic acids
(toph19.inp, param19.inp, toprna10r_22.inp and pardna10_22.inp) are
included in the toppar directory.  These parameters are stable, have
been used in a wide variety of systems and are of use in both vacuum
(with r dielectric) and in condensed phase simulations.

6) Parameter set for analysis of hydrogen bonds (par_hbond.inp) added
in July 1997 and all hbond parameters removed from the all-hydrogen
parameter files.  Note that the parameters in par_hbond.inp are for
analysis only.  Using them for energy, minimization and dynamics
calculations with give INCORRECT results.

7) Parameters for ACE continuum solvatiom model included
(acepar19.inp, acepar22_prot.inp, acepar27_na.inp).  These files are
to be used with the appropriate topology and parameter files and are
maintained by Michael Schaefer.

8) Topology and parameters for the Charge Equilibration (CHEQ)
electronic polarizable model included (top_all27_prot_na.rtf,
par_all30_cheq_prot.inp).  These should be considered a preliminary
polarizable force field for proteins.  Additional refinement in
progress.

9) A polarizable model based on a classical Drude oscillator is in
progress.  A drude subdirectory has been created that contains the
toppar files along with example inputs. See the 00readme file for
details.  Note that the Drude model is developmental and significant
additions and changes in the format are expected.  However, the
parameters included in this subdirectory are published and not
anticipated to change in the near future.

10) Parameters for silicate surfaces have been added to CHARMM.  These
have been placed in the subdirectory, silicates, which contains code
and examples to generate silicate surfaces.

11) Parmaters for ethers added to CHARMM. See top_all34_ethers.rtf and
par_all34_ethers.prm

12) non_charmm: Contains toppar files for AMBER, Bristol-Myers Squibb
(BMS) and OPLS force fields along with a stream file for the SPC and
SPC/E water models.  These files have been tested to the extent that
they may be considered reliable representations of the original force
fields, though potentially not exact representations.  These files are
NOT maintained and, thus, use at your own risk.  See the 00readme
files and note that AMBER requires a special version of CHARMM as
described in the 00readme file.

13) subdirectory tamdfff: An internal coordinate force field (ICFF)
that was built based on the CHARMM 22 protein force field.
Specifically, it provides a backbone covalent geometry suitable for
torsion angle molecular dynamics (TAMD) and the necessary CMAP
cross-term corrections to suppress distortions of the potential energy
surface due to rigid covalent geometry.  Additional details can be
found in tamd.doc.

14) subdirectory rush: A simple implicit-solvent protein force-field
that adds terms to the bonded portion (bond + angle + dihe + impr +
urey) of the all-atom CHARMM22 force field to account for
volume-exclusion (_R_epulsion), the hydrophobic effect (_U_nburied
_S_urface), and intra-molecular and protein-solvent hydrogen-bonding
(_H_ydrogen-bonding) (hence _R_ _U_ _S_ _H_). Usage instructions are
in doc/rush.doc

15) subdirectory gbsw: Optimized protein backbone parameters
(par_all22_prot_gbsw.inp) and atomic input radii (radius_gbsw.str) for
a balanced GBSW implicit solvent force field.  The backbone phi/psi
cross-term (CMAP) and the atomic input radii have been re-optimized
specifically to balance the solvation and intramolecular interactions
and to capture experimental conformational equilibria of both helical
peptides and beta-hairpins. Additional information can be found in
gbsw.doc.

Summary of c24b2_g1_g2_c25a0_a1_a2_a3 to c25b1/c26a1 topology and
parameter file changes. July 1997

Changes annotated with * will have an effect on
calculated energies and forces of the related compounds.

All the all-hydrogen topology files have been modified for use with
MMFF.  This includes addition of atomic type to MASS list,
specification of DOUBLE and TRIPLE bonds where appropriate and
addition of the TP3M MMFF water model.  No changes required in the
parameter files.  Note that these changes allow the CHARMM
all-hydrogen topology/parameter files to be used with the MMFF
facilities.  Note that the CHARMM all-hydrogen parameters are NOT
designed to be compatible with the MMFF parameters.  Use CHARMM with
MMFF parameters at your own risk.

The hbond parameters in all-hydrogen parameter files have been removed
simplied and a new parameter file, par_hbond.inp, added.  This may be
used for hbond analysis.  Note that the parameters in par_hbond.inp
are for analysis only.  Using them for energy, minimization and
dynamics calculations with give INCORRECT results.

Cutnb has been increased to 14.0 A in the all-hydrogen parameter files
to produce 2 A buffer region (ctonb is 12.0 A) optimal for heuristic
list updating.

proteins (also the top_all22_model.inp file):

  1) dihedral parameters for neutral glycine and glycine dipeptide added

nucleic acids: 

  1) PRES 3MET, 3'terminal Methyl patch added

  2) PRES NOBA, patch to delete all base atoms added.

  3) RESI NDPH, residue for reduced NADPH added. No NADP+ yet available.

lipids: 

  1) additional parameters for double bonds added. 

  2) 2-hexene added.

  *3) Additional NBFIXes associated with sodium (SOD), potassium (K) and
  magnesium (MG) added to make them consistent with nucleic acids (for
  Mg) and Benoit Roux's thesis (for SOD and K).  Changes also made in
  the combined protein_lipid files.  Energetics involving these ions
  will be effected by these additions.

Summary of c25b1/c26a1 to c26b1 topology and parameter file changes.
September 1998

Changes in the all topology and parameter files involved only bugfixes
and minor additions or corrections, as outlined below.

Changes annotated with * will have an effect on
calculated energies and forces of the related compounds.

1) Appropriate references added to initial portions of all files.

2) Detailed description of the form and variables of each of the
energy terms added in all files.

proteins:

  no changes

nucleic acids:

  1) minor corrections to NAD etc. IC tables

  2) RESI NADP, residue for oxidized NADP+ added.

lipids:

  *1) Correction to alkene parameters.  Includes additional refinement to
  improve agreement with a.i. for -C=C- surface.  See alkene reference.

  2) Commented parameters associated with ions removed.

par_hbond.inp

  1) Hbond parameters corrected to cover all (hopefully) possibilities.

toph19.inp

  1) Version number changed to 22 to maintain compatibility

Addition of new lipid and nucleic acid topology and parameter (all27)
files to c27a1.  These parameters will only be included in the
developmental version of Charmm27 to allow for testing.  

CHARMM27 force field

nucleic acids:

  1) The all27 nucleic acid parameters represent a complete overhall
of the Charmm22 nucleic acid parameters.  This was performed to
correct problems with the equilibrium between the A and B forms of DNA
as well as take advantage of an extensive amount of new experimental
and ab initio data on nucleic acid model compounds.  Manuscript
preparation is in progress with submission expected by the end of
1998.

  2) Alternate nucleic acid bases (5-methylcytosine, inosine) and
other compounds (ATP, NAD etc.) are effected by the changes such that
published data on these compounds cannot be exactly reproduced using
the all27 parameter set.  Tests and parameter reoptimization by adm
jr. have been performed in order to insure consistency with published
works.

lipids:

  1) New alkane LJ and dihedral parameters.  The LJ parameters have
been optimized to more accurately reproduce experimental condensed
phase properties (Yin and MacKerell) and the dihedral parameters have
been optimized to lower the butane CCCC gauche energy to 0.63
kcal/mole.  

  2) New phosphate charges and dihedral parameters to better reproduce
interactions of DMP with water and DMP conformational energetics.

proteins:

  1) No all27 protein parameter set is available as of Sept. 98.
Based on the changes in the nucleic acid and lipid files it is
expected that the protein all22 parameters will be compatible with the
all27 nucleic acid and lipid parameters, however, no explicit tests
have been performed to date.  The statement that compatibility can be
expected is based on the maintainence of the all22 parameter
optimization philosophy during the optimization of the all 27
parameters.  Please contact adm jr. for more details.

Summary of c27b? to c31a2 topology and parameter file changes.
July 2004

Reorganization of topology and parameter files was undertaken.  This
was performed to minimize the size of the parent topology and
parameter files (e.g. top_all22_prot.inp and par_all22_prot.inp) by
including only biomolecular subunits (e.g. the amino acids), the
relevant patches, water and ions.  The remaining molecules have been
moved to toppar stream files in the toppar/stream directory.

A significant change/correction was the removal of all ANGLe and
DIHEdral specifications in the topology files for the patches, except
in cases where special terms are required (eg. heme related patches).
For all of these special cases it is necessary to call AUTOgenerate
ANGLes DIHEdrals following implementation of all patches.

Summary of changes in version C41/42, 2016/8

  1) 'AUTOGENERATE ANGLE DIHEDRAl PATCH' added to all parent toppar
  files (including the Drude) to avoid missing parameters with
  patches.  Some issues with Heme patches dealt with using "noangle
  nodihedral" in the patch command.

  2) Lipid and carbohydrate stream files reorganized to avoid
  overlapping residues and parameters.  All glycolipids now in
  toppar_all36_carb_glycolipid.str.

  3) Fatty acids added to toppar_all36_lipid_detergent.str

  4) Modified RNA toppar file added
  (toppar_all36_na_rna_modified.str).  Includes an extensive set of
  modifications present in tRNA and other non-canonical RNAs.

  5) Extension of CGenFF to include the following.  This will yield a
  new verison of the CGenFF program in which the charge model will be
  updated. This leads to small variations in the charges assigned by
  the CGenFF program.

      i) New heterocycle parameters associated with the modified RNAs and to deal with new atom type
introduced in the modified RNA (In progress).
      ii) New halogen parameters that treat halogen bonds via a virtual particle.  NOTE: use "COOR SHAKe" 
following compound generation to build lone pairs
      iii) Addition miscellaneous model compounds.

  6) Patch DEOR added to top_all36_na.rtf to allow for RNA nucleotide
  in a DNA oligonucleotide.

  7) Correction to toppar_all36_prot_d_aminoacids.str.

  8) Modified version of the C36 protein force field to correct for
  oversampling of the alphaL conformation.  See par_all36m_prot.prm.
  No changes in top_all36_prot.rtf.  In addition,
  toppar_all36m_prot_d_aminoacids.str has been added to stream/prot to
  treat d amino acids with the modified version of c36m

  9) Sulfamate parameters added to the carbohydrates to allow for
  simulation of heparin and related systems.

  10) Conversin of MASS/atom type numbers to -1.  Takes advantage of
  the use of XPLOR format PSF files as the default as they don't
  require MASS numbers. This will avoid issues with repeated MASS
  numbers and allow for arrays to be adjusted based on the number of
  atom types actually used. As non-profit users can get new versions
  of the program, they will be able to use these files as needed. An
  old version of the files from the 2016/8 release will be maintained,
  but they will be discontinuted after that version.

Summary of changes in version C42/43, 2017/8

  1) Added subdirectories larmord, openmm_gbsaobc2, and stream/cphmd from the
C.L.B. III lab.  File protpatch_protein_toppar36.str added to
toppar/stream/cphmd directory

  2) All files in the toppar subdirectory that are included in the
final release (eg. files in toppar_jul17/toppar) will be maintained in
the Michigan GIT.  The procedure will allow for the files to be
maintained locally at UMB and then uploaded into the git repository
prior to new releases of CHARMM.  This will assure consistency with
the UM Git and the Hangyen SVN.  Information on performing the process
is in the MacKerell lab wiki.

http://mackerell.umaryland.edu/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.CharmmGitRepositoryAtUMich

3) New OPLS nucleoside and nucleotide parameters added to non_charmm
directory.  These have been combined with the recent revised protein
(opls_amm) version in files top_opls_aam_na.inp and
par_opls_aam_na.inp.  Test case test_non_charmm_opls.inp updated
accordingly.

4) Following added to top_all36_na.rtf

5) toppar_all36_na_nad_ppi.str: correct atom name from N71N to H71N.
As the atom type was correct the energies and forces are fine. Its
only an issue when doing analysis or visualizing the molecule (NAD
etc.).

6) toppar_all36_na_nad_ppi.str: new IC tables for AMP, ADP and ATP and
added residues for guanine, cytosine, thymine and uracil mono, di and
trinucleotides.


7) CGenFF updates

   New parameters added for compounds from D3R challenge (He, Yu, Yang
   and MacKerell) 

   NBFIX: SH to halogens

8) Additions and modifications of the carbohydrate and lipid stream
files by the Wonpil Im lab to include a broad set of molecules the
comprise biological membranes.  This represents a very large extension
of the force field with alterations to a number of residue and patch
names, additional parameters and modifications and new test cases.
The majority of the parameters were those previously optimized for the
CHARMM36 lipid and carbohydrate force fields with additional
parameters assigned by analogy.

5) Addition of halogen-protein NBFIXes. In addition, these are also
extended to the corresponding nucleic acid and carbohydrate atom
types. (Lin and MacKerell, to be submitted).

In par_all36_cgenff.prm and tests added to test_cgenff.inp

!!! IMPORTANT!!!

6) Ether lipid toppar files added to stream/lipid and new test case added to lipids

toppar_all36_lipid_ether.str
test_all36_lipid_ether.inp

7) rename d_amino acid toppar stream files in stream/prot

mv toppar_all36_prot_mod_d_aminoacids.str toppar_all36_prot_c36m_d_aminoacids.str
mv toppar_all36_prot_d_aminoacids.str toppar_all36_prot_c36_d_aminoacids.str

8) update indole (RESI INDO) and ethylindole (RESI EIND) in
toppar_all36_prot_model.str

This corrects on oversight where the 2005 update of the CHARMM Trp
sidechain parameters were not incorporated into the
toppar_all36_prot_model.str even though they were applied to the Trp
sidechain itself. This update makes them consistent with, though not
identical to those in CGenFF.  Produces new energies for indole and
ethylindole.

9) PNA residues/parameters replaced and LNA residue/parameters added
to toppar_all36_na_modifications.str Includes changes in
test_all36_na_modifications.inp

Summary of changes in version C44/45, 2019/8

1c) top_all36_prot.prm: In PRES CNEU atom name HT2 changed to HT2B to
avoid conflict with PRES NNEU.

1d) Residues and patches for methylhistidine have been created for both
the neutral and charged states. The new terms have been added to
toppar_all36_prot_modify_res.str.

! Full residues that may be used when a full protein is being generate
  and the appropriate residues have been renamed as follows.

4c) Reorganization of both the topology	and parameter files to allow
for integration of the release files with those used to train the
CGenFF program.  This will facilitate training of the CGenFF program
in the future as well as assure that the release and CGenFF program
based parameter files are consistent.  This included a couple minor
changes in partial atomic changes.  This will make the charges in the
topology file consistent with those output by the CGenFF program.

Version 4.3 of top_all36_cgenff.rtf and par_all36_cgenff.prm is
synchronized with Version 2.3 of the CGenFF program.

6) Toppar test cases in test subdirectory updated: 2019_7

test case input file restructured to read all toppar files by each
test case as listed in ./toppar.str. This allows dependencies between
the various toppar files to be taken into account.  This leads to
issues with overlapping residues/patch names that required a few
renaming of residues and patches (see below). Those changed were on
residues/patches that are rarely used and therefore will not impact
the large majority of users.

One problem with this is that the test cases run significantly slower
due to the reading of all the toppar files by each job.

7) Addition of UIUC ion NBFIX parameters in non_charmm/toppar_ions_nbfix_uiuc.str

toppar_ions_nbfix_uiuc.str: Contains a variety of NBFIX terms
optimized by Yoo and Aksimentiev, Univ of Illinois,
Urbana-Charmpaign. See the file for the approprate references.  As
these conflict with some of he defaul CHARMM36 additive NBFIX terms
they have not been included with the default toppar files. Note that
these are not tested.

Summary of changes in version C45/46, 2020/7

1) Proteins

1a) Update PRES LIG1 patch that required to create a cyclic peptide to
include CMAP. Note that this requires specifying 4 residues in the
patch statement to allow for the two CMAPs to be specified.  Patches
LIG2 and LIG3 deleted as they are redundant with LIG1. Test case
test_all36_prot.inp updated. See new_prot/lig_patches

1b) Update PRES LINK similar to that for LIG1. LINK creates a peptide
bond between images and currently requires that the angles and
dihedrals be explicitly specified.  Bernie is extending the
AUTOGENERATE code to deal with images.  In progress as of 2019_8_18.

##Bernie text:
Each of these patches needs two CMAP terms added.
And the script invoking them must be modified. 
The IMPATCH command must now specify four residues (instead of just 2).

Also, if running with images or crystal, the IMALL keyword should be used for the image update.

Here below is how I fixed the LINK patch and the LIG* patches

Also, I am now writing an autogen routine for image angles and image dihedrals.
When that is done, the ANGLE and DIHE specs will be removed, and LINK and LIG1 will be the same.
Note that LIG1, LIG2, and LIG3 are already all identical.  I don't know why you have all three there.
##End Bernie text

1c) Patch for Covalent link between G base and Cys sidechain added to
stream/na/toppar_all36_na_modifications.str and
stream/prot/toppar_all36_prot_na_combined.str. Included creation of
residue E1X (N1,O6-ethanoxanthine) and patch CE1X. In addition,
residues E1XM (methylated) and E1XE (ethyl modification) were created
for the parameter optimization targeting the MP2/6-31+G* geometry of
E1XM, HF/6-31G* water-E1XM interaction energies and the MP2/6-31+G*
dihedral potential energy scan of the ethyl group in E1XE. Previous
parameters based on 1-ethyl-guanine were updated.

See new_prot/new_prot/covalent_gua_cys

1d) Repeated angle parameter in prot_all36_prot.prm and
prot_all36m_prot.prm. First entry commented as the second entry
overrides the first such that commenting the first will not change
energies/forces.  As this is for Neutral Gly Nterminus it is rarely
used.

!NH2  CT2  CD    50.000    107.00              ! From ALA Dipep. NH1-CT2-C, Neutral Gly Nterminus
NH2  CT2  CD    52.000   108.0000

1e) RESI ASM renamed to ASPM in toppar_all36_prot_modify_res.str to
avoid conflict with toppar_all36_lipid_sphingo.str

1f) repeated parameters in toppar_all36_prot_modify_res.str commented
or removed, with all CGenFF atom type parameters moved to
par_all36_cgenff.prm. RESI NAPH: residue with naphthalene sidechain
added. Methylated residue ASPM, LEM, LYM added.

2) Carbohydrates

2a) addition of neutral and -1 phosphate patches to toppar_all36_carb_imlab.str based on standard methylphosphate charges
see new_carb/toppar_all36_carb_imlab_oct2019.str and toppar_all36_carb_imlab_oct2019.dif

2b) repeated parameters in toppar_all36_carb_imlab.str commented.

2c) repeated parametes in toppar_all36_carb_glycolipid.str removed.


3) Nucleic acids

3a) new residues
grep E1X toppar_all36_na_modifications.str
RESI E1XM         0.00  ! N1,O6-ethanoxanthine: methyl on N1
RESI E1XE         0.00  ! N1,O6-ethanoxanthine: ethyl on N1
RESI E1X         -1.00  ! N1,O6-ethanoxanthine: guanine with ethyl on the N1: C10-C11    

3b) toppar_all36_na_rna_modified.str: all model compound residues and
associated parameters moved to top_all36_cgenff.str and
par_all36_cgenff.prm. The residues and parameters are maintained in
the toppar_all36_na_rna_modified.str file after the final END
statement.

4) toppar_water_ions.str: Added the following

!Potassium NBFixes
